        <h2>A Short Story</h2>
            <p>This past week we've unfortunately had to deal with some medical concerns with our dog, Eliza.
              She was kicked by a horse, and while initially she seemed ok, the effects became clear. After consulting
              our vet, our only option was surgery. She went into surgury on Friday, and despite it seeming worse than
              thought, the surgury was entirely successful. Eliza is thankfully expected to make a full recovery, and is
              well on her way so far!</p><br>
